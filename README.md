This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function.  The `IsEmpty` function, when used to check for empty strings, does not differentiate between an uninitialized variable and an empty string (""). This can cause unexpected behavior in your scripts.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the issue, and `bugSolution.vbs` provides a solution using a more robust check.
